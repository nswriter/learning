        This page follows the Mozilla Developers' Javascript tutorial <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Getting_started/Your_first_website/Adding_interactivity" 
        target="blank">"Adding Interactivity"</a>. Below are my initial notes recapping the process.

    <img src="../Goof_Img/Ship1.png"width="50%">
    <p><i><b class="caption">Ship1: An arid landscape. Click the image to see some Javascript at work!</b></i></p>

   
 
    <h2>Changing the Image</h2>
    <p>
        This page utilizes an <em>Event Listener</em> Javascript tag to "listen" for a click on the page. This variable, named <i>myImage</i>,
        is tied to a <em>document.querySelector("img")</em> which means it will select all <i>img</i> tags on the page, and thus only accept clicks within
        the content of an <i>img</i> tag. 
    </p>
    <p>
        When a click is registered (or I suppose heard) it uses an if/else statement to modify the value of a variable <i>myImage</i>. 
        This variable is, by default, set to the image "Ship1", the arid landscape. When clicked, the variable changes the path using the if statement to
        lead to the "Ship2" image source, thus changing the displayed image to the arctic landscape. If clicked again, the variable uses the 
        "else" statment to reset the image source to the "Ship1" path, since it has detected that the image is not on "Ship1" already, and was thus changed,
        and so it needs to change it back. Each click will continue to cycle back and forth.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there were other images being used on this page, then it would be wise to replace the general ("img")
        selector with a more specific selector using a class name or id, something to tie the script to that specific image. Otherwise,
        all images on the page, regardless of their content, would suddenly flip irrevocably to "Ship1", because the "else" statement would still
        detect a lack of a "Ship1" source and automatically fill it back in, overwriting whatever source the other image had, and then locking this image
        into the same back and forth cycle between 1 and 2, never returning to the original image (until the page were to be refreshed, of course). 
    </p>
    <p>
        Note: I also added another constant using a class-based selector to change the caption for the images! I want to be able to change the alt text, too,
        but that might just be a task for another day. 
    </p>
    <h2>Changing the User Name Welcome Message</h2>
    <p>
        I must admit I found this little trick quite fun to mess around with. While in this basic state it lacks any true weight behind the "User"
        (that is only the name data item is stored, singularly, and only until it is overwritten--there is no retreivable profile) it grants the illusion,
        while providing an interesting building block for later experiments.
    </p>
    <p>
        This function uses a function (<i>setUserName</i>) to create a data item through the <em><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Storage_API" target="_blank">Web Storage API</a></em>, 
        meaning that whatever value gets assigned to it will be retained through localStorage on the web browser, retaining the information even if the browser gets closed.
         This means that, at least for a longwhile, this page will remember whatever name you entered as your username. Pretty neat! More reaserch is required.
    </p>
    <p>
        The functionality of this function is very similar in principle to the image selector above, but with some notable differences to account for its context.
        The function uses another <i>querySelector</i>, this time set to a class of ".Username", so that it interacts only with the one "p" tag in the header
        where the message is to be displayed. It would be pretty awkward if all of these notes just turned into a long list of "Welcome, y/n". I must say,
        the original tutorial didn't have notes, or titles, or anything of that sort, so I leveraged my past knowlege of HTML and CSS selector interactions, and indeed
        it works much the same. So that's cool.
    </p>
    <p>
        The other difference to the image selector is the functionality surrounding the popup. To summon this popup, and accept a text input, this function utilizes
        a nifty feature called <em>prompt</em> which accepts a string, which will be the text displayed in the popup. It also summons the popup itself, with the neccessary
        functionality built in. There is an issue, by default, where you can choose to click "OK" without having entered a name, in which it would display "Welcome,", or 
        you could click "Cancel" and it would close the popup and display "Welcome, null", with "null" being the default reply for an empty variable in Javascript.
        To cicrumvent this for the moment, the tutorial includes what is esentially a copy of the <em>myName</em> constant, within the same <em>setUserName</em> function,
         but this time includes an intervening "logical NOT" gate, <em>(!localStorage.getItem("name"))</em> to indicate that if localStorage does NOT have a name data item
         stored, the next if/else statement should be run. This if/else statement is, as noted, quite similar to the previous except that it is calling
         upon <i>const storedName</i> instead of <i>const myName</i>. This means that unless an input is added, creating or overwriting
         the "name" data unit, it will continue to relaunch the popup. Once a "name" data unit is found, it becomes the <i>storedName</i>, and the else half of the function
         will write that name into the ".Username" designated "p" tag, and all is well.
    </p>
    <p>
        The "Change User" button simply uses another <i>querySelector</i> to detect if the button is pressed, and if it is, it launches the <i>setUserName</i> function
        (I spelled that funtion so many times) above, allowing the stored user name to be, well, changed.
    </p>

        My Thoughts
    </h2>
    <p>
        This was honestly a really fun excercise, and a great introduction (or kinda-sorta reintroduction) to Javascript. The tutorial was very well constructed
        and super easy to follow, and did a great job of explaining the steps involved, and what they actually do and mean (far better than I did above). 
    </p>
    <p>
        I must say, too, that while I might not write as comprehensive of a breakdown every time, I do feel like this process of explaining what I just did
        was indeed quite helpful. A bit of reflection on the process definitely helped me, at least right now in the moment, to feel like I better understood what I
        just worked on. Hopefully it will help refresh my memory down the line, when I inevitably get distracted from Javascript for a time and forget everything.
    </p>
    <p>
        Special shoutout to English 381 and co. for inspiring me to sit down and start getting into Javascript again. Also, why is my battery at 50%, it's plugged in. Hmm.
        Anyways, goodnight. It's past 3AM on the first night of class. Of the first day of Spring 2025, for posterity's sake. What a productive start! 
        But I've really got to go to bed! Happy coding!
