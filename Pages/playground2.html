<h2>Some Brief Thoughts</h2>
<p>
    This excercise was, at the start, presented as a kind of inspirational practice. As such, it threw a lot of stuff
    in the mix, "coming attractions", if you will. Some of the code featured was familiar, but a lot was brand new. While
    not focused on teaching everything covered--promising instead to get back to that later--the tutorial did still
    dedicate a welcome amount of time explaining what certain chunks of code were doing. Overall, I would say
    that I understood a good deal of what was happening, even if I can't quite yet replicate it or put it to use
    elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
    Ultimatly, though, this excercise achieved its goal brilliantly. It produced a small, fun game which was 
    certainly rewarding, even if I was just following a tutorial.
</p>
<p>
    However, I didn't just leave it at that. Originally I had tried to include the game above, but the JavaScript 
    required a line of code <i>document.body.append(resetButton);</i> which is needed to create a new button at the
    bottom of the game to start a new game. The "body" tag in question is where a problem arose, as it calls upon
    the entire body of the HTML file. I tried wrapping the game in a div with a class, but could not get the 
    code to accept any reference to the class. So, I pivoted. I decided to try to figure out how to get the game
    to launch in a new window, and a quick search provided a handy feature, <i>window.open</i>. Copying the code
    and fiddling with it, it finally worked. The JavaScript is built into the <i>a</i> tag itself, which
    MDN advises against, but it works for now. It is placed in the <i>href</i>, and directs the browser to open
    the html file where the game is now housed, defines how far from the top and left of the screen to open the window,
    as well as what size to open it. It took a lot of fiddling to get the size right, but it seems to work. I would like
    to get the window to open in the center of the screen, but couldn't quite get that to work yet. So, for now,
    it just kind of hangs out on the outskirts of the top-left corner. Again, works for now!
</p>
<p>
    I also added code to allow the victory message to display how many guesses you used to get the number right,
    and the "Wrong!" message to display how many guesses you have left. This seemed like useful information to
    present. It was pretty simple, actually.
    
    I inserted <i>let guessLeft = (10-guessCount);</i> in the "else" statement controlling the "Wrong!" message,
    and in that wrong message I adjusted it from <i>lastResult.textContent = "Wrong!";</i> to 
    <i>lastResult.textContent = `Wrong! ${guessLeft} guesses left!`;</i> In the "if" statement above the guessCount
    is incremented, and so the let the guessLeft pull from this new data. If I put it earlier in the code, it wouldn't have
    access to the number. I made a similar adjustment to the victory message, only in this case I could use the
    guessCount itself.


    
</p>
<p>
    Also, a note. The player name next to the "Launch Game Window" link is very similar to the username button
    of the previous excercise. Similar, especially, in that it does not do anything. It's just there, part of the
    previous page on the MDN tutorials that I didn't want to get rid of. So now it just hangs out with the 
    game launcher, giving the illusion of user data.
</p>
<p>
    Anyways, definitely interested to see what's next!
